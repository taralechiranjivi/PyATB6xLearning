# ✅ Grade Calculator:
# Write a program that calculates and displays the letter grade
# for a given numerical score (e.g., A, B, C, D, or F)
# based on the following grading scale

# A: 90-100
# B: 80-89
# C: 70-79
# D: 60-69
# F: 0-59

# Logic Building Formula

# 1 -> User Inputs - score -> int
# 2 ->  O/p -> str -> A, B

score = int(input("Enter the score: ").strip())

if score > 100 or score <= -1:
    print("❌ You are  Superman!!, you can't get a grade!! :)")
else:
    if score >= 90 and score <= 100:
        print("Your grade is A")
    elif score >= 80 and score <= 89:
        print("Your grade is B")
    elif score >= 70 and score <= 79:
        print("Your grade is C")
    elif score >= 60 and score <= 69:
        print("Your grade is D")
    else:
        print("Your grade is F")
